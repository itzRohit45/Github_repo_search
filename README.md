## Quick overview (1‚Äëminute)

- A single text input (debounced at 300 ms) queries GitHub's Search Repositories endpoint.
- The app displays the top 30 results as cards showing title, description, stars, language, and owner avatar.
- Each card has a star toggle to bookmark repositories. Bookmarks persist to localStorage and survive page reloads.
- You can either (1) filter the current search results to show only bookmarked items, or (2) switch to a view that shows all saved bookmarks.

## 1) Quick start

Clone and run locally:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Rohit
npm install
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:5173
```

Notes:
- The search input has id `search-input` (the header "Start searching" button focuses this input).
- Bookmarks are stored under the localStorage key `github-bookmarks` as a JSON array of repository objects.

---

## 2) Scripts

- `npm run dev` ‚Äî start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` ‚Äî typecheck (tsc) and build production bundle
- `npm run preview` ‚Äî preview production build
- `npm run lint` ‚Äî run ESLint (configured to fail on warnings)
- `npm run format` ‚Äî run Prettier across the codebase

---

## 3) How it works (implementation details)

Search
- `src/hooks/useGitHubSearch.ts` performs the GitHub API call to `GET https://api.github.com/search/repositories` and returns the first 30 results (`per_page=30`). The hook exposes `{ repositories, loading, error }`.
- Debouncing is handled in `src/pages/SearchPage.tsx` via `useDebounce` (300 ms) to reduce API calls.

Bookmarks
- Bookmarks are managed by `src/context/BookmarkContext.tsx` using `useReducer`.
- Bookmarks are stored as a map (id ‚Üí Repository) for O(1) lookups and are also exposed as an array for listing.
- Persistence: bookmarks are loaded synchronously during reducer initialization from localStorage (key `github-bookmarks`) to avoid a race condition where an early save could overwrite stored data. Any changes are saved back to localStorage.
- UI: `RepositoryCard.tsx` shows a star button that calls `toggleBookmark(repository)`.
- Filter behavior (two modes):
  - "Bookmarked only" (FilterToggle) limits the current search results to those that are bookmarked.
  - "All Bookmarks" shows the entire set of saved bookmarks across searches.

Performance
- Components use `React.memo` and event handlers are memoized with `useCallback`.
- Expensive derived values (filtered lists) use `useMemo`.

Error / empty states
- `RepositoryList.tsx` contains dedicated UI for loading, empty, and error states, along with helpful suggestions.

Types
- Repository shape is defined in `src/types/repository.ts`. Bookmarks store full repository objects so the bookmarked list can be rendered even when those repositories aren‚Äôt present in the current search results.

## 4) Project structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ components/        # UI components (SearchBar, RepositoryCard, RepositoryList, FilterToggle)
‚îú‚îÄ context/           # BookmarkProvider and hook (useBookmarks)
‚îú‚îÄ hooks/             # useDebounce, useGitHubSearch
‚îú‚îÄ pages/             # SearchPage (app page wiring)
‚îú‚îÄ types/             # Repository type
‚îú‚îÄ App.tsx            # Root component (header + page)
‚îî‚îÄ main.tsx           # App entry (mounts BookmarkProvider)
```

---

## 5) Decisions, trade-offs and future work

What I prioritized
- Simplicity: no external state libraries ‚Äî Context + reducer covers the bookmarking use case well.
- Performance: avoid unnecessary re-renders using memoization.
- UX: clear empty / loading / error states and a friendly welcome screen to exercise features quickly.

Trade-offs / future work

Trade-offs / future work

### What Could Be Enhanced (Given More Time)
- **Testing**: Unit tests (Jest), integration tests (React Testing Library)
- **Pagination**: Load more results beyond the first 30
- **Advanced Filters**: Filter by language, stars, date
- **Sorting**: Custom sort options (stars, forks, updated)
- **Search History**: Track recent searches
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions for state changes
- **PWA**: Offline support with service workers
- **Dark Mode**: Theme toggle
- **Export/Import**: Bookmarks backup functionality

## üöß Possible Next Steps

1. **Add Testing Suite**
   - Jest + React Testing Library
   - E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress
   - Minimum 80% code coverage

2. **Enhance Features**
   - Infinite scroll or pagination
   - Search history with local storage
   - Share bookmark collections

3. **Performance**
   - Implement React.lazy for code splitting
   - Add a service worker for offline support
   - Optimize bundle size

4. **UX Improvements**
   - Add keyboard shortcuts
   - Implement drag-and-drop for bookmarks
   - Add animations with Framer Motion

5. **Deploy & Monitor**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Add error tracking (Sentry)
   - Performance monitoring (Web Vitals)

## üìù API Rate Limiting

GitHub API allows 60 requests/hour for unauthenticated requests. For production:
- Implement GitHub OAuth for higher limits (5000 requests/hour)
- Add rate limit indicators to UI
- Cache results for common searches

## üé¨ How to Test the Demo

1. **Open the app** ‚Äî you'll see a welcome screen
2. **Click a suggestion** ‚Äî try "React" or "TypeScript"
3. **Bookmark repositories** ‚Äî click the ‚òÜ button on any card
4. **Filter bookmarks** ‚Äî use the "‚≠ê Bookmarked Only" toggle
5. **Search custom terms** ‚Äî type anything in the search bar
6. **Check persistence** ‚Äî refresh the page; bookmarks remain!
