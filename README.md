# üîç GitHub Repository Search

A focused React + TypeScript micro-app to search GitHub repositories and save bookmarks locally.

This README is intended to be a single-source reference for installing, running, and understanding the app. It also includes a short design notes section explaining architecture choices and future work.

## üöÄ Live Demo

If deployed, add the public URL here. Example providers: Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages.

---

## Quick overview (1‚Äëminute)

- One text input (debounced at 300ms) queries GitHub's public Search Repositories endpoint.
- The app shows the top 30 results as cards (title, description, stars, language, owner avatar).
- Cards have a star toggle to bookmark repositories. Bookmarks persist to localStorage and survive reloads.
- You can (1) filter the current search results to show only bookmarked items, or (2) toggle a view to show all saved bookmarks.

## 1) Quick start

Clone and run locally:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Rohit
npm install
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:5173
```

Notes:
- The search input has id `search-input` (used by the header "Start searching" button to focus the input).
- Bookmarks are stored under localStorage key `github-bookmarks` as a JSON array of repository objects.

---

## 2) Scripts

- `npm run dev` ‚Äî start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` ‚Äî typecheck (tsc) and build production bundle
- `npm run preview` ‚Äî preview production build
- `npm run lint` ‚Äî run ESLint (configured to fail on warnings)
- `npm run format` ‚Äî run Prettier over the codebase

---

## 3) How it works (implementation details)

Search
- `src/hooks/useGitHubSearch.ts` performs the GitHub API call to `GET https://api.github.com/search/repositories` and returns the first 30 results (per_page=30). The hook exposes `{ repositories, loading, error }`.
- Debouncing is handled in `src/pages/SearchPage.tsx` via `useDebounce` (300ms). This reduces API calls.

Bookmarks
- Bookmarks are managed by `src/context/BookmarkContext.tsx` using `useReducer`.
- Bookmarks are kept as a map (id -> Repository) for O(1) lookups and also exposed as an array for listing.
- Persistence: bookmarks are read synchronously during reducer initialization from localStorage (key `github-bookmarks`) to avoid a race where an early save overwrites stored data (this was an important bugfix). Any changes to bookmarks are saved back to localStorage.
- UI: `RepositoryCard.tsx` shows a star button that calls `toggleBookmark(repository)`.
- Filter behavior (two modes):
  - "Bookmarked only" (FilterToggle) limits the current search results to only those bookmarked.
  - "All Bookmarks" button shows the entire set of saved bookmarks (across searches).

Performance
- Components use `React.memo` and event handlers are memoized with `useCallback`.
- Expensive derived values (filtered lists) use `useMemo`.

Error / empty states
- `RepositoryList.tsx` contains dedicated UI for loading, empty and error states and helpful suggestions.

Types
- Repository shape is defined in `src/types/repository.ts`. Bookmarks store full repository objects so the bookmarked list can be rendered even if those repos aren‚Äôt present in current search results.

## 4) Project structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ components/        # UI components (SearchBar, RepositoryCard, RepositoryList, FilterToggle)
‚îú‚îÄ context/           # BookmarkProvider and hook (useBookmarks)
‚îú‚îÄ hooks/             # useDebounce, useGitHubSearch
‚îú‚îÄ pages/             # SearchPage (app page wiring)
‚îú‚îÄ types/             # Repository type
‚îú‚îÄ App.tsx            # Root component (header + page)
‚îî‚îÄ main.tsx           # App entry (mounts BookmarkProvider)
```

---

## 5) Decisions, trade-offs and future work

What I prioritized
- Simplicity: no external state libraries. Context + reducer covers the bookmarking use-case well.
- Performance: avoid unnecessary re-renders with memoization.
- UX: clear empty / loading / error states and a friendly welcome screen to exercise features quickly.

Trade-offs / future work
- Tests are not included yet ‚Äî adding unit/integration tests is the next priority.
- Pagination / infinite scroll: currently the app fetches 30 items per request (per requirements). If you need more results add paging.
- Better rate-limit handling and optional GitHub authentication for higher API limits.

## How to test bookmarks and filters (manual)

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Search for a term (e.g. `react`) or click a popular suggestion
3. Click the star on a card to bookmark it ‚Äî confirm `github-bookmarks` is present in localStorage and contains the repository object
4. Toggle `‚≠ê Bookmarks` to show only bookmarked items in the current results
5. Toggle `All Bookmarks` to view all saved bookmarks
6. Refresh the page: bookmarks should remain

## Contribution

PRs welcome. If you submit changes, please ensure `npm run lint` passes and add tests for new behavior.

If you'd like, I can:

- add a small GitHub Actions workflow to run lint & build on every PR
- add a short deployment guide with an actual Vercel deploy configuration
- add a small test suite (jest + React Testing Library) with 2‚Äì3 tests for bookmarking and filter behavior

If you want me to update README with your repo link and a live demo URL, tell me the deployed URL and I'll add it.
